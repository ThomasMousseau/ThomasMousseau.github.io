    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Thomas Mousseau</strong>, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence 
      at Polytechnique Montr√©al. I am actively seeking a research-focused lab and supervisor for a 
      part-time position this Fall, transitioning to a full-time commitment in Winter for my final 
      Master's project. My ultimate goal is to continue my research journey as a <strong>Research 
      Master's student in Fall 2026</strong> within the same lab, focusing on <strong>fundamental 
      research in Reinforcement Learning or Deep Learning</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in AI has been significantly shaped by leading the <strong>Driverless division of 
      Formule Polytechnique</strong> for over a year. This experience immersed me in full research 
      and development cycles, from critically assessing cutting-edge papers and implementing 
      proofs-of-concept to full-scale integration and iterative improvement. Under the guidance of 
      <strong>Pier-Marc Rivet</strong>, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in applied research 
      methodologies and scientific rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been fortunate to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical settings through two 
      impactful <strong>Machine Learning Engineer internships</strong> at <a href="https://www.airy3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIRY3D</a> and 
      <a href="https://clinia.com/en-ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLINIA</a>. These roles allowed me to fine-tune and enhance various models, developing 
      a strong intuition for asking the right questions and cultivating a <strong>scientific mindset</strong> 
      through collaboration with experienced AI researchers. This applied research experience has 
      provided me with a solid foundation to now pursue <strong>fundamental theoretical contributions</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> provides a crucial advantage, enabling 
      me to approach projects with a broader perspective and anticipate potential challenges in 
      research implementations. This interdisciplinary foundation allows me to bridge the 
      gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications effectively, while my current 
      focus shifts toward advancing the <strong>theoretical foundations</strong> of AI systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my <strong>publications</strong> and <strong>CV</strong> 
      to learn more about my research experience and technical background. I'm eager to discuss 
      potential research opportunities that align with my interests in transitioning from 
      <strong>applied AI research to fundamental theoretical work</strong>. Whether you're interested 
      in discussing research directions in Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning theory, or 
      potential lab placements, I'd love to connect and explore how my applied research background 
      can contribute to advancing fundamental AI research.
