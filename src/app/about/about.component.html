    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Thomas Mousseau</strong>, a Master's student in <em>Artificial Intelligence</em> 
      at Polytechnique Montr√©al. I am actively seeking a research-focused lab and supervisor for a 
      part-time position this Fall, transitioning to a full-time commitment in Winter for my final 
      Master's project. My ultimate goal is to continue my research journey as a <strong>Research 
      Master's student in Fall 2026</strong> within the same lab.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey in AI has been significantly shaped by leading the <strong>Driverless division of 
      Formule Polytechnique</strong> for over a year. This experience immersed me in full research 
      and development cycles, from <em>critically assessing cutting-edge papers</em> and implementing 
      proofs-of-concept to full-scale integration and iterative improvement. Under the guidance of 
      <strong>Pier-Marc Rivet</strong>, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in applied research.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been fortunate to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical settings through two 
      impactful <strong>Machine Learning Engineer internships</strong> at <em><a href="https://www.airy3d.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AIRY3D</a></em> and 
      <em><a href="https://clinia.com/en-ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLINIA</a></em>. These roles allowed me to fine-tune and enhance various models, developing 
      a strong intuition for asking the right questions and cultivating a <strong>scientific mindset</strong>, 
      particularly through collaboration with experienced AI researchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      My background in <strong>Software Engineering</strong> provides a crucial advantage, enabling 
      me to approach projects with a broader perspective and anticipate potential challenges in 
      <em>research implementations</em>. This interdisciplinary foundation allows me to bridge the 
      gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through my experience in the <strong>Driverless division</strong>, I've developed expertise 
      in the complete research lifecycle - from literature review and hypothesis formation to 
      experimental design, implementation, and validation. This hands-on approach to research, 
      combined with my technical background, has prepared me well for contributing meaningfully 
      to advanced AI research projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to explore my <strong>publications</strong> and <strong>CV</strong> 
      to learn more about my research experience and technical background. I'm eager to discuss 
      potential research opportunities and collaborations that align with my interests in 
      <em>applied AI research</em>. Whether you're interested in discussing research directions, 
      potential lab placements, or academic partnerships, I'd love to connect.
