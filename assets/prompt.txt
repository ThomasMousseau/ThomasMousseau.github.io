Alright, time to put together a bio that really captures who I am—professionally and personally. 
Let’s break this down step by step and make sure I highlight what matters most such as the name of the establissement and organization I worked in or for.

First I want so set the scene with my current goal and what differentiates me from the rest of the students. 

I am currently enrolled in the Professional Master in Artificial Intelligence at Polytechnique where I will be looking for a supervisor and I lab where I can work part-time during
the Fall semester and full-time during the Winter as part of my final Master's project. Then hopefully, my goal would be to join the same lab as a Research Master Student in Fall 2026.

I had the opportunity to lead the driverless division of Formule Polytechnique for over a year which forced me to go through multiple research developpement cycles including 
reading cutting-edge papers, assessing their feasibility, implementing a proof of concept, integrating it at full scale and then finally develop our own better version 
based on the lesson learned. This opportunity allowed me to experience applied research under the supervision of Pier-Marc Rivet.

I am very furtunate to have my last 2 internships in as Machine learning engineer, at both Airy3D and Clinia, I was able to  finetune, and improve different models which let me apllied my theorical knowldge of thr filed in a partical aspect.
Being teamed with AI researchers help me developed the necessary intution to ask the right question and become a better scientent myself.

Finally, my background in Software Enginereing has help me tremendously through all of my internships and will continue to help me in graduate school since I have developped an intuition to see project with a bigger lens thus have 
helped me avoid potential problems when building a project or when implementing the latest research experements


Alright—let’s weave these threads together and tell my story!


As a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Polytechnique Montréal, I am actively seeking a research-focused lab and supervisor for a part-time position this Fall, transitioning to a full-time commitment in Winter for my final Master's project. My ultimate goal is to continue my research journey as a Research Master's student in Fall 2026 within the same lab.

My journey in AI has been significantly shaped by leading the Driverless division of Formule Polytechnique for over a year. This experience immersed me in full research and development cycles, from critically assessing cutting-edge papers and implementing proofs-of-concept to full-scale integration and iterative improvement. Under the guidance of Pier-Marc Rivet, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in applied research.

I've been fortunate to apply my theoretical knowledge in practical settings through two impactful Machine Learning Engineer internships at AIRY3D and CLINIA. These roles allowed me to fine-tune and enhance various models, developing a strong intuition for asking the right questions and cultivating a scientific mindset, particularly through collaboration with experienced AI researchers. My background in Software Engineering provides a crucial advantage, enabling me to approach projects with a broader perspective and anticipate potential challenges in research implementations.
